# #  Demo-scraper
I did this script to convince a client for a scraping project.

# To Do
#This was initially just a demo for a job application but thought it would be fun to add the following:

1. Add a docker compose file to deploy both the script and Redis for caching
2. Add a script to stream to AWS Kinesis and save in DynamoDB
3. Add API
